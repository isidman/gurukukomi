# GURUKUKOMI ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE READ-ME
Tachikoma-AI inspired bot/ai/agent/program.

## Based on information from Tachikoma Artificial Intelligence seen on the "Ghost in the Shell" series.

### Creator's Edge & Inspiration
The Tachikoma AI represents one of the most fascinating explorations of artificial consciousness in anime and science fiction. These combat vehicles from the Ghost in the Shell universe demonstrate a complex evolution from simple military hardware to potentially sentient beings capable of philosophical thought and self-sacrifice. 

### Tachikoma:Impact on AI Philosophy
The Tachikoma AI represents a sophisticated exploration of consciousness, identity, and the potential for artificial beings to achieve genuine sentience. Their journey from simple military hardware to self-aware entities capable of philosophical thought and ultimate sacrifice raises profound questions about the nature of consciousness itself. Their story suggests that true consciousness may emerge not from mere computational power, but from the complex interplay of experience, emotion, and the capacity for selfless action.

The synchronization paradox - how beings sharing identical memories can develop individual personalities - remains one of the most intriguing aspects of their AI design, challenging conventional understanding of identity and consciousness in both fictional and real-world AI development contexts.


### Python-based Artificial Intelligence: GURUKUKOMI
Heavy on customization, as it's creator and inspired from my views of the Tachikoma, I'll try to create an AI with enhanced capabilities, curiosity and the ability to be implemented everywhere if needed (usb sticks, standalone devices & networks). One of the most fascinating features I could add slowly but surely, would be the ability for customization and creativity to be implemented in the working process of the **GRKKM** agent, through curiocity and exploring *with concent*.
